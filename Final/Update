Shop works when the player walks into the shop's collider. Will need to check a way of disabling after player moves from the hitbox.


KeyBinds:
M - Bring up Map
K- Bring up Shop
ESC - Close Shop


Currently unsure how to access the player's actual health, mana and gold stat so have used place holders. 
Shop can be exploited slightly in terms of gameplay.



Forgot about bringing the inventory from the starting level to the boss level, currently working on this. 
(Fudged fix implemented as issues with transferring scenes and the previous instances of the inventory/shops being a nightmare to carry over scenes)
