Think all of the previous things I've uploaded have gone to a personal repository rather than the master branch. 
Code for the minimap, possible shop script and map generation are included. The inbuilt unity scenes have issues being ported out of unity onto github and back, so will add in if asked.
Code will need to be attached to unity editor pieces when things begin to be finalised. For all the code I produce I can connect things up in the editor.
Sprites will be uploaded here as completed.
