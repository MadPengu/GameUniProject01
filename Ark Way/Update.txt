Having a lot of issues with conflicting or buggy scripts when trying to add in scripts for the inventory system. Can implement shop system to directly place items in the player's inventory. 

(Found problem, currently fixing the conflicting issues)



In this version that was uploaded, movement/animation seems to not be working


Will continue to try and get the shop implemented





In PlayerController, at the top Using.System has been added
