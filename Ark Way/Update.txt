Can implement shop system to directly place items in the player's inventory, but having issues with other scripts and editor fields. 




Will continue to try and get the shop implemented

Unsure how the UImanager works in terms of in editor fields and I think that its blocking any of my changes from appearing on screen. 
Have uploaded a version which should hopefully keep all in editor fields filled



In PlayerController, at the top Using.System has been added
